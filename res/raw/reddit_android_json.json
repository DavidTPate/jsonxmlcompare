First, I just wanted to give you guys another thank you for helping make TV Portal the success it is becoming. Without you, we wouldn&amp;#39;t have our huge initial surge back in November. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you haven&amp;#39;t heard of TV Portal yet, it is simply an app that indexes sources from around the Internet and packages them in a very easy to find, yet currently very unappealing visually, way. Don&amp;#39;t worry, #HOLO is coming. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mitechlt.tvportal.play\"&gt;Download TV Portal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bsplayer.bspandroid.free&amp;amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDEsImNvbS5ic3BsYXllci5ic3BhbmRyb2lkLmZyZWUiXQ..\"&gt;Download BSPlayer for streaming&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.zloy.android.downloader&amp;amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDEsIm9yZy56bG95LmFuZHJvaWQuZG93bmxvYWRlciJd\"&gt;Download LoaderDroid for downloading&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you need any help setting TV Portal up, please see our &lt;a href=\"http://tvportal.net23.net/FAQ/bsplayer.html\"&gt;pictorial walkthroughs&lt;/a&gt;, and if those don&amp;#39;t help, send me an email at &lt;a href=\"mailto:tvportalapp@gmail.com\"&gt;tvportalapp@gmail.com&lt;/a&gt;. Please hold off on negative reviews, and give me a chance to try and help you out before posting negative feedback.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Today or tomorrow, we&amp;#39;ll be crossing the 500,000 install threshold, and growth is only increasing. Again, we owe you guys a huge thanks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Enough with the expressions of gratitude though. This post is to get every single one of your suggestions and make sure that we do 2.0 right. Ian was by himself in creating this initial version of TV Portal, and simply wanted to create a tool to index TV shows and movies from around the Internet. I don&amp;#39;t think many can disagree it does a pretty good job of that. However, with our 2.0, we want to create the best TV and movie watching experience. I think &lt;a href=\"/r/Android\"&gt;/r/Android&lt;/a&gt; is the best place to come for suggestions. Let&amp;#39;s hear &amp;#39;em.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Please see below for the list of features me and Ian have put together, and tell us absolutely anything you&amp;#39;d like to see in addition to what we&amp;#39;ve already come up with.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.0 Features list:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;+Holo Themed UI redesign&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-If anyone would like to make some mockups of some attractive UIs, feel free. I&amp;#39;ll include everything on our &lt;a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.501026373249567.118776.497518200267051&amp;amp;type=3\"&gt;Facebook page&lt;/a&gt;, clearing crediting the creator, and linking to any of your other works if you&amp;#39;d like. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-I also wanted to give a shout out to a few apps we think look great and function brilliantly that we will be using as inspiration for our redesign.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.miz.mizuu_beta&amp;amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDEsImNvbS5taXoubWl6dXVfYmV0YSJd\"&gt;Mizuu&lt;/a&gt;: A beautiful app for organizing local media. See especially how Trailers are organized for movies. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.battlelancer.seriesguide&amp;amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDEsImNvbS5iYXR0bGVsYW5jZXIuc2VyaWVzZ3VpZGUiXQ..\"&gt;SeriesGuide&lt;/a&gt;: I&amp;#39;m sure most of you have already heard of SeriesGuide already.

				"selftext": "Hello r/Android. First, I just wanted to give you guys another thank you for helping make TV Portal the success it is becoming. Without you, we wouldn't have our huge initial surge back in November. \n\nIf you haven't heard of TV Portal yet, it is simply an app that indexes sources from around the Internet and packages them in a very easy to find, yet currently very unappealing visually, way. Don't worry, #HOLO is coming. \n\n[Download TV Portal](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mitechlt.tvportal.play)\n\n[Download BSPlayer for streaming](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bsplayer.bspandroid.free&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDEsImNvbS5ic3BsYXllci5ic3BhbmRyb2lkLmZyZWUiXQ..)\n\n[Download LoaderDroid for downloading](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.zloy.android.downloader&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDEsIm9yZy56bG95LmFuZHJvaWQuZG93bmxvYWRlciJd)\n\nIf you need any help setting TV Portal up, please see our [pictorial walkthroughs](http://tvportal.net23.net/FAQ/bsplayer.html), and if those don't help, send me an email at tvportalapp@gmail.com. Please hold off on negative reviews, and give me a chance to try and help you out before posting negative feedback.\n\nToday or tomorrow, we'll be crossing the 500,000 install threshold, and growth is only increasing. Again, we owe you guys a huge thanks.\n\nEnough with the expressions of gratitude though. This post is to get every single one of your suggestions and make sure that we do 2.0 right. Ian was by himself in creating this initial version of TV Portal, and simply wanted to create a tool to index TV shows and movies from around the Internet. I don't think many can disagree it does a pretty good job of that. However, with our 2.0, we want to create the best TV and movie watching experience. I think /r/Android is the best place to come for suggestions. Let's hear 'em.\n\nPlease see below for the list of features me and Ian have put together, and tell us absolutely anything you'd like to see in addition to what we've already come up with.\n\n**2.0 Features list:**\n\n+Holo Themed UI redesign\n\n-If anyone would like to make some mockups of some attractive UIs, feel free. I'll include everything on our [Facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.501026373249567.118776.497518200267051&amp;type=3), clearing crediting the creator, and linking to any of your other works if you'd like. \n\n-I also wanted to give a shout out to a few apps we think look great and function brilliantly that we will be using as inspiration for our redesign.\n\n[Mizuu](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.miz.mizuu_beta&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDEsImNvbS5taXoubWl6dXVfYmV0YSJd): A beautiful app for organizing local media. See especially how Trailers are organized for movies. \n\n[SeriesGuide](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.battlelancer.seriesguide&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDEsImNvbS5iYXR0bGVsYW5jZXIuc2VyaWVzZ3VpZGUiXQ..): I'm sure most of you have already heard of SeriesGuide already. We'll be trying to implement the same functionality of tracking shows you've watched and will also be trying to improve on the already great looking design.\n\n[Cliffhanger](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cliffhanger&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDEsImNvbS5jbGlmZmhhbmdlciJd): I believe this app was only released within the last couple of weeks, if not this week. Absolutely brilliant looking design, with great functionality. \n\nMake sure to check those apps and leave them great ratings, as they are simply brilliant. If you find something that you'd like improved, it is much more encouraging to receive constructive criticism through email first, and then if your suggestions aren't implemented or at least address, *then* leave a rating reflecting that.\n\n+Tons of new sources (please include your favorites so we can add them)\n\n+Improve ease of setup (see SwiftKey initial setup walkthrough)\n\n+User ranking system for link play quality (image quality, start speed, accuracy)\n\n+Incorporate ratings from sites like IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, TVDB, etc (allow user to choose preference)\n\n+Searches for Actor, Director, Writer, Year Released, etc\u2026\n\n+Descriptions, thumbnails, for movies &amp; TV\n\n+Instant subtitle downloader\n\n+Block content based on rating, unlock with code\n\n+Sync Favorites and History (in the background) across primary Google account\n\n+Track shows / movies watched (SeriesGuide, trakt.tv)\n\n+Similar users viewed \n\n+Share links via Text, Email, Facebook, Twitter, etc\n\n+Sort by Channel (CBS, NBC, ABC, FOX, AMC, USA, etc\u2026)\n\n+Shows watched tracking improved (SeriesGuide, Cliffhanger)\n\n+Sort by Box Office Revenue\n\n+Turn off 'Run At Startup' option\n\n+Instantly request content after a empty search\n\n+VIP Users (fill out information, ability to add content and monitor content and have more weighted flags for incorrect content)\n\n+Ability to revert to older APKs\n\n+Tag and filter HD or SD content\n\n+Show information about file size\n\n+View history and delete history\n\n+Construct a hierarchy of preferred streaming sites and enable automatic play\n\n+More diversified pricing structure (Users who have previously upgraded won't be affected whatsoever. Once you're in, you're in.)\n\n+Trailers in Movie description\n\n+GTV Search Box functionality\n\n+TV / Large Tablet, Phone Optimization\n\n+Include the ability to change or clear default video player through TV Portal\n\nThose are just about all the features we could think of, but like I said, this post is for ***your*** suggestions, so let's see what great ideas you guys can help us come up with.\n\n[TV Portal on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mitechlt.tvportal.play)\n\n[TV Portal Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/TVPortalApp)\n\nI've got class and lab today, but will be responding to all comments and messages as soon as I have some time.
